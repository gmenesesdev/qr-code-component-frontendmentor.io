## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Root variables


### What I learned

I have always had complications with CSS, but after several trials and errors, I think I have done a good job.

If you have any comments, please tell me.

### Continued development

I would like to continue with this project and have it have the functionality of creating a QR code by entering the desired link, so this will be the initial template.

### Useful resources
